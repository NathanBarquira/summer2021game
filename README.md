This is my first github project. I've made projects before this. but this is the first one I uploaded to GitHub.

I also uploaded this project working on it initially. I didn't think I would upload this to GitHub but I decided to get serious while in the middle of working on it.

the highscores.txt file should be ignored!

the "dist" folder should include all the exe files for each version published!
